REFLECTION: 
We worked on this project entirely at school and we worked together on all aspects of it.  The only
part that we worked separately was that Lucia manipulated the ending flower image and that Nina did final edits
for the runner code, and inserting comments for how the code works.  As for outside sources, we used the given
examples and Stack Overflow occasionally.  The images were from Google Images.  We mainly used Stack Overflow 
so that we could understand what certain commands did.

HOW TO PLAY:
1) click the green "start" arrow in eclipse to run Rainfall_Runner.java
2) use the arrow keys (left and right) to move the watering can
   goals: 
   - avoid the black raindrops (-1 life)
   - catch the blue raindrops (+1 point)
3) use the space bar to shoot rings at the black raindrops (+1 pt)
4) the second part is after you have moved on; click on the screen to watch a plant being watered which is dependent
   on how many points you got in the first round
